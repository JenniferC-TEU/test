## Introduction

We are going to use this simple markdown document to practice the steps of creating a merge request on GitLab (aka "pull" request on GitHub).

```
git add Test.md
git commit -m "Here's a message"
```

And now some other words, and then maybe a bigger change.

Now on this branch we're going to add some changes.
